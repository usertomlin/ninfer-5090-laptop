# NInfer

> Selected checkpoints. Maximum single-GPU inference performance.

NInfer is a from-scratch C++/CUDA inference engine for explicitly registered model artifacts on
NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, verified on GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5060 Ti. It runs text, image, and video
prompts through a local CLI or OpenAI-/Anthropic-compatible HTTP APIs. The runtime is deliberately
specialized: one GPU, one resident model, and a startup-fixed capacity of one to eight active
requests.

NInfer supports seven artifact identities. The quick-start commands use Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4.

The artifact identity fixes the exact model and weight profile. Every artifact also embeds the
tokenizer, chat template, and media frontend resources required by its registered target.

The Qwen3.5-9B artifact is a 4,096-wide, 32-layer dense model with 24 linear-attention and eight
full-attention layers plus one MTP layer. Ornith-1.5-9B uses the same registered execution geometry
and MTP route under target key `ornith_1_5_9b`; its converter dequantizes the official NVFP4/FP8
source checkpoint to BF16 before applying the groupwise-int profile and preserves Ornith's
ThinkingToggle frontend. See the [Qwen3.5-9B artifact reference](docs/maintainer/qwen3.5-9b-artifact.md)
and [Ornith-1.5-9B artifact reference](docs/maintainer/ornith-1.5-9b-artifact.md).

In addition, the Qwen3.5-4B artifact is a 2,560-wide, 32-layer dense model with 24 linear-attention and eight
full-attention layers plus one MTP layer. The Qwen3.5-2B and Qwen3.5-0.8B artifacts are 24-layer
dense models with 18 linear-attention and six full-attention layers each, at 2,048 and 1,024 wide
respectively, and one MTP layer each. Their converters apply the groupwise-int profile directly to
the official BF16 checkpoints, tie the full output head and the draft head to the language-model
embedding matrix, synthesize the missing `generation_config.json`, and use checkpoint-specific
vision towers instead of the shared Qwen3.6 ones (24 layers at 1,024 wide for 4B and 2B, 12 layers
at 768 wide for 0.8B).

## Quick start

NInfer requires 64-bit Linux, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 or RTX 5060 Ti, CUDA Toolkit 13.1 or newer,
CMake 3.28 or newer, a C++20 host compiler, Ninja, `pkg-config`, FFmpeg development libraries
(`libavformat >= 60`, `libavcodec >= 60`, `libavutil >= 58`, and `libswscale >= 7`), and
`libcurl >= 7.85`. The build rejects CUDA architectures other than `sm_120a`.

Build the product binaries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer.git
cd ninfer

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

Tests, benchmarks, and maintainer tools are excluded from the default build. There is no install
target or packaged binary distribution; run NInfer from its source build tree.

Download the artifact used by this example with the Hugging Face CLI:

```bash
hf download neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer \
  qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --local-dir models
```

The 9B artifacts are also published for the 5060 Ti route:

```bash
hf download ruwwww/ornith-1.5-9b-ninfer ornith_1_5_9b.ninfer --local-dir models
# Or: hf download ruwwww/qwen3.5-9b-ninfer qwen3_5_9b.ninfer --local-dir models
```

Start a long-running text/agent server with two active-request lanes and explicit Device/Host
checkpoint capacity:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --max-context 240000 \
  --kv-capacity 240000 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --device-state-slots 2 \
  --host-state-slots 8 \
  --host-kv-mib 8192 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

Each request has a 240,000-token logical ceiling. A shared 240,000-token Device KV pool serves
admitted requests; two requests run concurrently when their combined reservations fit. The cache
tiers provide two Device checkpoint slots, eight pinned Host State slots, and 8 GiB of pinned Host
KV beyond the two active StateImages.

Send an OpenAI-style request:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with one short sentence."}],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }'
```

Run a one-shot CLI request with a 32,768-token allocation:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --prompt "Explain prefill and decode, then give a concise conclusion." \
  --max-context 32768 \
  --max-new 8192 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

Answer content is written to stdout. Human-readable startup/runtime diagnostics and the CLI-owned
reasoning, timing, throughput, memory, and speculative-decoding report are written to stderr;
reasoning and the result report remain unprefixed product output. On a terminal, weight
materialization uses one transient progress line followed by a compact Engine-ready summary.
Redirected stderr receives persistent readable progress without terminal control sequences. Use
`--log-level debug` for complete startup detail. Option and local input errors remain direct command
diagnostics. Use `--messages FILE` and `--vision` for structured image/video input; see the
[CLI guide](docs/cli.md) and [committed examples](examples/cli/).

## Resource-aware long-context reuse

A reusable prefix checkpoint contains KV and the complete continuation state for its exact prompt
frontier. A Device-resident checkpoint resumes directly. Under pressure, the planner weighs Device
retention, pinned Host State/KV, and eviction by immediate restore work and later reuse cost. Active
requests retain their completion reservations.

See [Resource scheduling and context cache](docs/maintainer/resource-scheduling-and-context-cache.md)
for the algorithm and [Serve TTFT benchmark](tools/bench/ttft/) for public-HTTP coverage of hot
reuse, Host resume, eviction, shared prefixes, scheduling boundaries, and multimodal load.

## Performance

Published measurements use an RTX 5090. The [performance index](docs/performance.md) links to
per-model run records and the [measurement rules](docs/performance/methodology.md). The tables
below are excerpts from those detailed results.

### Concurrent MTP3 decode

Saturated decode used INT8 group-64 KV, CUDA Graphs, MTP3, and one 8,192-token generation per active
request. Throughput uses aggregate committed decode tokens from complete intervals whose actual
decode batch equaled the configured concurrency. Acceptance covers the complete request wave;
these rates are steady decode (tok/s).

| Model profile | C=1 tok/s / accept | C=2 tok/s / accept | C=4 tok/s / accept | C=8 tok/s / accept | C8 / C1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| [Qwen3.6-27B](docs/performance/qwen3.6-27b.md#decode-saturation) `groupwise-int` | 185.8 / 68.2% | 247.0 / 69.0% | 309.5 / 68.4% | 535.0 / 68.3% | 2.88× |
| [Qwen3.6-27B](docs/performance/qwen3.6-27b.md#decode-saturation) `nvfp4` | 202.4 / 69.3% | 399.7 / 71.4% | 699.7 / 69.3% | 1,146.9 / 68.6% | 5.67× |

### Single-request serving

The serial serving corpus used INT8 group-64 KV, CUDA Graphs, a 1,024-token prefill chunk, and five
fixed seeds after warm-up. The table keeps one short-prefill, one extreme-prefill, and one
structured-output MTP3 point for each published profile; the full context and scenario matrices are
linked from each model below.

| Model profile | 7,680-token prefill | 260,096-token prefill | Structured MTP3 decode |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| [Qwen3.6-35B-A3B](docs/performance/qwen3.6-35b-a3b.md#single-request-speculative-decode) `groupwise-int` | 17,705.4 tok/s | 5,247.0 tok/s | 779.6 tok/s |
| [Qwen3.6-27B](docs/performance/qwen3.6-27b.md#single-request-speculative-decode) `groupwise-int` | 3,218.1 tok/s | 1,614.8 tok/s | 193.0 tok/s |

## RTX 5060 Ti verification and benchmarks

The branch (ruwwww/ninfer-5060ti) also runs on a GeForce RTX 5060 Ti (16 GB). Cooperative-launch residency is resolved
from the device's runtime SM count rather than a fixed RTX 5090 value, and cooperative schedules
step down to a less-aggressive split when the requested grid cannot be resident. The measurements
below are single-run verification on this 40-SM card, separate from the five-seed RTX 5090 results.

Qwen3.5-9B (`groupwise-int`) used INT8 KV, a 4,096-token prefill chunk, a 262,144-token context,
MTP3, and greedy sampling:

| Prompt tokens | Prefill tok/s | Decode tok/s | MTP acceptance |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 25,602 | 2,614.6 | 119.4 | 83.3% (3.50 tok/round) |
| 25,602 (warm prefix) | — | 112.8 | 76.6% (3.30 tok/round) |
| 25,604 (thinking off) | 2,598.8 | 105.5 | 68.8% (3.06 tok/round) |

Ornith-1.5-9B (`groupwise-int`) used INT8 KV, MTP3, `--lm-head-draft`, and a 32,768-token
context:

| Prompt tokens | Prefill tok/s | Decode tok/s | MTP acceptance | Note |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 27,025 | 2,523.1 | 131.8 | 66.7% (3.00 tok/round) | needle retrieved exactly |
| 2,010 | 2,580.8 | 72.7 | — | greedy, MTP off |

Concurrent committed decode throughput with MTP3:

| Model | C=1 | C=4 | C=8 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.5-9B | 118.8 tok/s | 204.0 tok/s | 317.9 tok/s |
| Ornith-1.5-9B | 108.2 tok/s | 191.1 tok/s | 309.9 tok/s |

The Ornith long-context wave (1,953 prompt tokens and 256 generated tokens per lane) measured
88.4, 107.8, 126.9, and 217.6 aggregate tok/s at concurrency 1, 2, 4, and 8 respectively.

## RTX 5090 laptop verification and benchmarks

This branch also runs on a GeForce RTX 5090 laptop (24 GB). Cooperative-launch residency is resolved from the device's runtime SM count rather than a fixed RTX 5090 value, and cooperative schedules step down to a less-aggressive split when the requested grid cannot be resident. The measurements below were obtained by launching ninfer-serve separately for each model, running tests/measure_serve_generation_speed.py against the local instance, and then shutting the server down — repeated across all models listed.

Qwen3.5-4B (groupwise-int) with FP8 KV, a 4,096-token prefill chunk, a 262,144-token context, MTP3, and greedy sampling:

## Evaluation

Capability scores were measured through NInfer's OpenAI-compatible serving route with thinking
enabled, MTP3, and EvalScope 1.9.0 (0-shot, rule scoring, one sample per problem):

| Model profile | AIME 2025 | AIME 2026 | GPQA-Diamond | ERQA | RealWorldQA |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| [Qwen3.6-27B groupwise-int](model-cards/Qwen3.6-27B-NInfer/README.md) | 86.67% | 93.33% | 86.87% | — | — |
| [Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4](model-cards/Qwen3.6-27B-nvfp4-NInfer/README.md) | 93.33% | 93.33% | 84.34% | — | — |
| [Qwen3.6-35B-A3B groupwise-int](model-cards/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NInfer/README.md) | 90.00% | 90.00% | 85.35% | — | — |
| [Qwen3.8-27B groupwise-int](model-cards/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer/README.md) | 96.67% | 96.67% | 87.37% | 66.25% | 82.22% |
| [Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4](model-cards/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer/README.md) | 96.67% | 96.67% | 90.40% | 66.25% | 83.53% |

The Qwen3.6 rows used temperature 0.6 and presence penalty 1.0; the Qwen3.8 rows used temperature
1.0 and presence penalty 0.0. Multimodal evaluation used `--vision` and an 81,920-token context
limit. Text evaluation used 262,144 tokens except Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4, which used 252,928 tokens to
fit the RTX 5090 after weights. Each score is one sample per problem; model cards contain the
correct/total counts and evaluation notes.

## Startup notes

GPU residency is fixed at process startup. `--spec` selects speculative decoding residency, and
`--vision` independently selects Vision residency. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B DFlash can be combined with
Vision; it accelerates generated-text decode after multimodal prefill, not Vision encode itself.

## Docker

Build the runtime image on a host with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:

```bash
docker build --tag ninfer:local .
```

Mount the downloaded model and run the same example server profile:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --gpus '"device=0"' \
  --publish 8080:8080 \
  --volume "$PWD/models:/models:ro" \
  ninfer:local \
  ninfer-serve /models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --max-context 240000 \
  --kv-capacity 240000 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --device-state-slots 2 \
  --host-state-slots 8 \
  --host-kv-mib 8192 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

## Capabilities and limits

All registered model IDs support:

- text generation with thinking and non-thinking prompt modes;
- image, multi-image, video, and mixed multimodal messages;
- chunked prefill, exact-batch CUDA Graph decode, and startup-bounded batched decode;
- MTP speculative decoding with draft windows from one to five;
- BF16, INT8, FP8, NVFP4, and K8V4 KV storage;
- offline causal-perplexity scoring;
- private and shared exact-prefix reuse with Device/Host State and KV retention;
- model-aware sampling defaults and explicit sampler overrides;
- OpenAI Responses Core, OpenAI Chat Completions, and Anthropic Messages, including streaming,
  tools, local response state, token counting, and usage accounting.

The 35B-A3B target additionally supports DFlash with draft windows from one to fifteen for Text and
image/video Vision prompts. Qwen3.8-27B artifacts with the DFlash2 companion weights support
`--spec dflash2 --draft-tokens 7` for the same Text/Vision Engine path, with draft counts 1..15
and either full or optimized proposal heads.

The product boundary remains intentionally small:

- one supported Blackwell GPU (verified on RTX 5090 and RTX 5060 Ti) and one resident model per
  Engine;
- a startup-fixed capacity of one to eight active requests with bounded FIFO ingress;
- no request preemption, priority/QoS, active-request swapping, weight offload, multi-GPU, or
  distributed serving;
- one shared startup-fixed KV pool across active requests and retained prefixes;
- no runtime model discovery or unregistered checkpoint fallback;
- parsed tool calls are returned to the client; NInfer does not execute tools;
- the in-tree C++ headers are not distributed as an installed SDK.

`--max-context` is each sequence's logical limit. `--kv-capacity` sizes the shared Main Text KV pool
used by active requests and retained prefixes; `auto` resolves the largest legal capacity at
startup from the memory remaining after weights while keeping 1 GiB of sizing headroom. Explicit
capacities remain fixed for the process lifetime.
